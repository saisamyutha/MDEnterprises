                <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> A system and method for remote identification of a driver of a vehicle includes a processor, an output device in communication with the processor, an RFID receiver in communication with the processor, and a network access device in communication with the processor. The processor is configured to transmit the received RFID to a database via the network access the device and receive from the database the name of a person or item associated with the RFID device and criminal history of the person or the item associated with the RFID device. The processor is configured to provide to an operator of the law enforcement vehicle the name of a person or item associated with the RFID device and the criminal history of the person or the item associated with the RFID device and provide a warning how to engage the person or the item associated with the RFID device.</p>

                <h2>Systems and methods for identification of a person using live audio and/or video interactions</h2>

                <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> A system for a live identification of a person includes a cloud based database having data cross-referencing an identifying marker of the person and previously collected biometric information including an audio signature and a video signature, and a mobile data terminal which is configured to: receive an identifying marker of the person, transmit the identifying marker to the cloud based database, receive contact information of the person from the cloud based database; contact the person using the contact information; receive current biometric information from the person in the form live audio/video interaction; transmit current biometric information to the cloud based database, and receive a confirmation from the cloud based database. The mobile data terminal issues a clearance to the person. The system provides both a local identification where the person is physically present within a facility, and a remote identification where the person cannot be directly contacted in person.</p>
