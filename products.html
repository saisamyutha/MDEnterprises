                <p>
                  Our innovative live shipment tracking system offers a robust solution for real-time package monitoring,
                  significantly enhancing the security and reliability of logistics operations. This system is crucial in
                  minimizing highway crimes and ensuring that shipments are not lost or tampered with during transit. Each
                  package is continuously monitored using advanced tracking technologies, with real-time data transmitted
                  to a secure cloud-based database. This database logs detailed information about the shipment's location
                  and status, allowing immediate detection and response to any anomalies. By ensuring the integrity and
                  security of shipments, our live shipment tracking system provides peace of mind to businesses and
                  consumers alike, reducing the risk of lost or stolen goods and enhancing overall supply chain
                  efficiency.

                  A remote identification system features a processor, output device, RFID receiver, and network access
                  device. It transmits RFID data to a database to retrieve information and criminal history of associated
                  persons or items, then provides this data to law enforcement operators along with engagement warnings.
                  The system also allows vehicles to transmit and receive RFID signals, facilitating inter-vehicle
                  communication and location tracking, enhancing situational awareness in both law enforcement and other
                  settings.

                  Our patented LBIT (Live Biometric Identification Technology) for Banking &amp; Financial transactions
                  prevents fraud and authenticates using multifactorial biometrics while thwarting sim-cloning, man-in-the
                  middle attacks etc. Instead of the current OTP (one time password), the financial institute sends a
                  random phrase which the person has to say it one's own voice. The user's biometrics will be collected in
                  an authorized way and in a secure environment. The authentication process does NOT involve tokens
                  generated by the authentication server avoiding any capture in transit.

                <p>
                  Our patented Mass Transit Security system introduces a robust method for the live identification of
                  individuals using audio and video interactions. Designed to operate both locally and remotely, it
                  utilizes a cloud-based database that stores biometric data such as audio and video signatures alongside
                  other identifying markers. A mobile data terminal initiates the process by transmitting an identifier to
                  the database, which returns the person's contact details. Subsequent steps involve live audio/video
                  interactions to gather current biometric information, which is securely transmitted back to the database
                  for verification. Once confirmed, clearance is issued, facilitating secure access in varied scenarios,
                  including financial transactions and secure facility access.
